# Ray Summit 2025

## Overall
Really like this summit! Must took them a ton of eforts to prepare 🙂
I checked their last year's videos, most of the talks were technical without sharing business background 😵‍💫. This time all the talks I attended started with clear business background then clear tech talk. Was it because of my Youtube feedback? Even if it's not I'm feeling happy to see such arrangement. Also got the chance to chat with different people, hearing different insights. I honestly feel what I'm doing is pioneering for enterprise AI 😄
Anyway, really enjoyed this summit! 💖
The only pity is, didn't chat with Robert in person. But what can I say to him at this moment...?
