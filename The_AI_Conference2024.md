* [Llama Index][3] enables querying form large amount of info more efficiently
  * [It has many integrations][4]
* [Phoenix][9] traces LLM application runs, to help you understand what's happening under the ground
* [Stability AI][6], it provides open source image, video, language models (has specific Japanese trained model)
  * [Check its models][7]
  * [Generative models github][8]
* [Andi search][1], search without ad or spam.
  * Hmm, I tried some search, not that accurate....


## Lessons Learned from Founders
* If customers need more accurate results, such as BI reports, building AI Assistant is better than building AI Chatbot, because current AI technique is not mature enough to handle
