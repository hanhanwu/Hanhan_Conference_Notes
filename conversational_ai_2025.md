# Conversational AI Innovation Summit 2025

## Visual Question Answering (VQA)
* It's for querying about the visual, and to get answers.
* Geometric problems
* Parametric Methods
  * Chain of Thought (CoT)
  * GeomVerse
  * Lessons Learned
    * LLM didn't out perform human
    * LLM can have wrong formulas, problems in calculations & interpretability
* Solution: LLM to code to solve the problem
  * <b>GeoCoder</b> is trained on how to code
  * Image & Function Library & Query --> GeoCoder --> Generated Code --> Interprete --> Answer
  * RAG is used to retrieve the most relevant 5 functions
    * Level 1, 2 queries (simpler problems), RAG solution worked better than GeoCoder
    * Level 3 has more complex queries, GeoCoder worked slightly better than RAG
   
## AI Projects to ROI
* Understand the problems
  * Undertand which steps cost more money/time
* Engagement
  * Let people pariticipate in AI solutions
* Analysis
  * Propose AI development pipeline
  * Show opportunities by numbers
* Tracking Progress
  * Usage analysis
  * Quantitive feedbacks
* Make sure the process is repeatable

I'd better go to conferences with lots of engineering experts, otherwise it's tooooo boring to me~
