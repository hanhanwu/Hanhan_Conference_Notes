# KDD 2020

I didn't attend the full conference, but saw some links shared by the professors and felt might be useful.

## [AutoKnow][1]
* This is a research from Amazon, it almost does everything itself to build the knowledge graph used in e-commerce
* [The paper][2]

## [Data Pricing Tutorial]
* Yes, it literally means the "price of data".... I was attracted by "economics", later found it is economics style. And it seems that this tutorial has a responsiblity beyond education, which might be to teach companies to be fair when they are selling the data.
* [What is data pricing][3]
* [The economic of data pricing][4]
  * There could be price discrimination based on your behavior. For example, if your behavior appears to care about the privacy more, maybe you need to pay more for the data
